# Website Optimization 

Included are my attempts to improve the performance of the portfolio and pizza sites. To view - download all files. The portfolio is index.html and the pizzeria page is pizza.html located under the folder views. The portfolio can also be viewed through this [link](https://lemeigh.github.io/webop2/).

#### Changes I Made

##### Portfolio

* Inline CSS
* Async Google Analytics and JS
* Created CSS resource to load the font
* Optimized JPEG images

##### Pizza

* Moved variables outside of for loops
* Changed some of the queryselectors to getElementbyID or getElementbyClass


#### Credit Where Credit is Due

To start this project I was pretty lost in the sauce. Thank goodness for the forum (this [one](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/project-4-how-do-i-optimize-the-background-pizzas-for-loop/36302) in particular) and specifically these folks - with their sites, I was able to check if I was headed in any direction at all:
