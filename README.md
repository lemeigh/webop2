# Website Optimization 

Included are my attempts to improve the performance of the portfolio and pizza sites. Just download the whole file and open index.html in your browser!

#### Changes I Made

##### Portfolio

* Inline CSS
* Async Google Analytics and CSS
* Created 2nd CSS page to load the font

##### Pizza

* Moved variables outside of for loops
* Changed some of the queryselectors to getElementbyID or getElementbyClass


#### Credit Where Credit is Due

To start this project I was pretty lost in the sauce. Thank goodness for the forum and specifically these folks - with their sites, I was able to check if I was headed in any direction at all:
